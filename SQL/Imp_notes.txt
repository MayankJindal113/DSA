Dual Tables : Dummy tables in SQL
print a table without using 'FROM'
> select now ();
> select ucase ('mayank');


select class from courses
group by class having COUNT (*) > 4;
The above query is incorrect find why ?



# Bcz we cant give space between the fucnction name and its value ;
correct would be using: COUNT(*)

# *Each derived table must have its own alias;
i.e : Each table returned by a sub query should be assigned a name
Eg :
select num from (select num from tabel_name group by num) as num;
